# The Open Dietary Project

There are lots of dieting apps in the world, but most of the useful features they contain are behind paywalls. We are a small team endeavoring to empower people to take control of their health through technology made free and accessible.

## How do I use Open Dietary?

Please check it out at our alpha website: opendietary.vercel.app

## Will you be free forever?

Yes, we pledge to make this software free and available to as many people as we can, forever.

## How do I contribute?

We welcome pull requests! As we grow in size and complexity we will establish contribution guides and tutorials. For now, the code should be easy enough to follow as a straightforward Next.js app (e.g. clone, cd web, npm install and npm run dev).
